# About

Hello world! Are you a researcher working primarily using Stata? Do you ever:
- get a headache working with cross-platform (e.g. Windows vs Mac OS)?
- try to reproduce a code published by other researchers but it doesn't work out on your machine?
- all of the above?

Imagine that you can avoid all of that. And that's what this repository is aiming for!

# What you need
I hope that you are using a legitimate Stata licese code because in order to run
Stata do-file using GitHub Actions you need:
- Serial number
- Code
- Authorization

# How to run?
Before going any further, you may want to `fork` this repository first and GitHub
Secrets on `Settings -> Secrets` tab. What you need are the following:

- AUTHORIZATION
- CODE
- EMAIL
- FIRST_NAME
- LAST_NAME
- SERIAL_NUMBER
- URL
- USERNAME

That's it! Then you can go to `Actions` tab and just click `Run workflow` and voila!
You've just run a Stata do-file using GitHub's owned machine. ðŸ˜€

# P.S.
Don't hesitate to reach me out for further questions.
